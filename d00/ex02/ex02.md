## Order of operations
1. mkdir test0 test2
2. touch test1 test3 test4
3. symlink: ln -s ./test0 ./test6
4. use dd to change sizes of each file
6. hardlink test5 to test3
7. change permissions
8. change modification date/time for all but the symlink
9. change modification date/time for symlink
9. tarball everything

## Creating a symlink or softlink
```
ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
```
## Changing timestamp on symlink
```
touch -h -t YYYYMMDDHHMM <sym_link>
```
## Columns in ```ls -l```
1. permissions
2. number of hardlinks
3. file owner
4. file group
5. file size
6. modification time
7. file name

## Hardlinking
```
ln <old file> <new link>
```

## Difference between softlink/symlink and hardlink
Stolen from [this stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/185899/what-is-the-difference-between-a-symbolic-link-and-a-hard-link)... another good explanation [here](http://www.geekride.com/hard-link-vs-soft-link/)

A file in the file system is linked to an inode. An inode is a datastructure that represents a filesystem object which stores the attributes and disk-block location(s).

A hard link creates another file with a link to the same inode. Deleting a file removes one linked to the inode. All links to the inode must be deleted to delete the inode (link count becomes 0). Only work within the same filesystem.

A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system (basically a pointer, new file with new inode). Symbolic links can span file systems.
